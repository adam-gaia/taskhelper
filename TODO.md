# TODO

- \[ \] Instead of just grabbing the project name, It would be cool to match on the project type (cargo.toml, pyproject.toml, etc) and pull the name from there.
- \[ \] nix package should install links to path for multicall other names
- \[ \] Add a config file
  - \[ \] taskwarrior path option
- \[ \] Check grammar/spelling of new task descriptions
- \[ \] Add doccomments to args for better clap help output. Take descriptions from taskwarrior's help page
